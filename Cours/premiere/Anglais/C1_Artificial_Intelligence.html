<h1 class="h1">C1L1 - Are robots for real ?</h1>
<h4>Exercice: </h4>
1) This picture shows a robot. It is shaped like a dog. It was made by Boston Dynamics. It has four legs, probably because it is more stable than with only two.  
2) This robot looks awesome because it seems to be very useful. It looks like a dog, maybe because it gives it a friendly attitude. It looks like a robot I have seen in a movie 
3) It has the capacity to walk in a challenging terrain like a warehouse or a desert, a factory. It can work within a range of -20°C to 45°C  and under the rain. It has a reprogrammable API to give it instructions as wanted. It has camera and can avoid objects around itself.
4) I think it was created to realize tasks dangerous or hard for a human, in cold or very hot places, with shrapnel or debris. It can rescue people in hazardous situations or lift heavy or radioactives payloads for example. I know SpaceX use some of them to check their rockets boosters after landing on their boats.
5) Yes, I'm a lot impressed. And it is available to buy. 
6) Oil, gaz, building, manufacturing, power, 

<h4>Correction :</h4>
4) Maybe it was created help to help humans on dangerous worksites. Perhaps it was designed for blind peoples. 

5) I am not impressed because the robot is not useful yet but in the future, this technology will improve
   I am really impress in that I did not know robots were able to do all that. I think this technology will probably be really useful in all kinds of situations. 

6) Spot can be used in different contexts such as:
   - in factories, 
   - in mines,
   - on offshore oil platforms,
   - in power plants or nuclear power plants, 
   - in construction sites, 

7) Even if this kind of robot has great benefits, they could also raise new problems :
   - They could be hacked and it wold cause a security breach
   - They could be used by the military
   - Or by terrorists 
   - People may loose their jobs
   - Etc...

<h1 class="h1">C1L2 - Let's meet Ava</h1>
This is a still form the movie *Ex Machina* by Alex Garland (2015).  
We can see a humanoid robot. It's a close-up shot (un gros plan). The robot is called Ava, it is really beautiful, it is looking directly at us,  which is quite ==unsettling==. We feel ==ill-at-ease== (= ==uncomfortable==) because we know it is not human. 
On her neck she has wires.
Despite its beauty, she gives a feeling of danger. 

<hr>

## AP Mardi soir (Atlas)
- It is capable of jumping / able to jump / has the capacity to jump / can jump
- It is able to navigate on its own
- It has the capacity to walk on ==uneven== terrain (rocks, sand, snow)
- It can open a door
- This robot ==reminds me of== one I saw in Black mirror. It is very similar to the one in the series. 

![[Le Comparatif (anglais).jpeg]]
- Atlas is taller than Spot and is louder than Spot. 
- Atlas is more agile than Spot and can jump and walk everywhere. 
- Atlas is less strong than Spot therefore can lift and carry less heavy payloads. 
- Atlas is as useful as Spot, it is just not built for the same purpose. 

<hr>
She ==may be== able to walk. → Construction verbale (may=modal)
She is able to walk.
==Maybe== she is able to walk. → Adverbe

Maybe Ava is able to think by herself. 
Maybe she is able to fight.
Maybe she can use the 5 senses that characterize humans. 

<h2 class="h2">What is AI ?</h2>

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) : the ability of a digital ==computer== or computer-controlled robot to ==perform tasks== commonly associated with ==intelligent beings==.

2. Artificial Intelligence is the ==simulation== of ==human intelligence== processes by machines, especially computer systems.


2) 
1. <b>Description of Ava</b>
	Woman face
	Uncomfortable
	She
	Blurry line 
2. <b>Americans and AI</b>
	Imitate humans
	Like a human (better)
	Emotions
	American companies
	Smart Home
3. <b>AI can be dangerous</b>
	Breakthroughs
	Dangerous
	Scary 
	What we should do
	It's an interview. 

3) He uses the pronoun "she"
"It's uncomfortable because we know she a robot but she is attractive."

<h3>Correction</h3>

2) 1. **Description of Ava** 2. **Americans and AI** 3. **AI can be dangerous**
3) The man uses the pronoun "she" to talk about Ava. It is normally the pronoun use to describe humans. We are uncomfortable because it shows that the line between robots and humans is blurry. 
4) Attractive, beautiful, smart, strong. The opposition shows we don’t know what to think: we are confused.

6) The man explains that the USA have a major role in the development of AI. 
    AI is a breakthrough (une avancée majeure) 
7) 
   - We have to be careful because AI is incredible ==and yet== (=cepandant) it can be dangerous.   
   - AI is incredible, however it may be dangerous. 
   - Even if/Even though AI may be dangerous, it is incredible.  
   - Ai may be dangerous never the less it can  be dangerous.

##### HOMEWORK
**Complete the text below with the words provided:** 
computer algorithms - the human mind - machine learning - voice recognition systems

Once a computer scientist's dream, artificial intelligence and **computer algorithms** are now part of our daily lives in the form of **voice recognition systems**, product recommendation platforms and navigation tools. All of these rely on **machine learning** that process information and solve problems in a way similar to - and sometimes superior to - **the human mind**. 

*Autrefois le rêve d'un ingénieur informatique, l’intelligence artificielle et les algorithmes font partie de notre vie de tous les jours sous forme de reconnaissance vocale, recommandation de produits, et de systèmes de navigation. Tous ces systèmes reposent sur l'apprentissage machine qui traite les informations et résout des problèmes dans un sens similaire - et parfois supérieur - à l'esprit humain.* 

###### Mots composés : 
- artificial intelligence
- voice recognition systems
Quand on a affaire avec un groupe nominal composé, on cherche d'abord le nom principal qui est à la fin. Les autres viennent le qualifier. 
- a computer algorithm
- a face recognition system 
- Face ID™
- a new complex artificial robot intelligence

*Westworld* is a TV show that was released in 2016 on HBO in the USA.
It tells the story of a fictional amusement park called *Westworld* in which humans can have fun with robots and live a new momentary life.
They can be nice to robots or harm them. There are no consequences because they are just robots.
Would you like to go to *Westworld* to have fun ?

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sofia | Sofia is calm and keeps on smiling. It tries to be funny by playing rock-paper-scissors with Jimmy. It is able to wink. It is very calm. It is very impressive. It is very stiff.I find Sofia very impressive and scary because it has the same attitude as a human.It seems to have difficulties to speak. I don't think she can show real facial expressions because of her robotic face. |
| Jimmy | He is focused and uncomfortable in that it is not a normal situation to speak with a robot. He is completely absorbed / fascinated / ==mesmerized==. He is a little bit scared too. He is joking uncomfortably / ==awkwardly==. 

###### Conclusion
It does not appear to be a real-situation interaction because the robot is not capable of showing enough emotions : we know it is not human. 

##### Homework 
Would you like to go to Westworld ?

I personally would not want to go to this park. First of all, this place is based on the fact that you could do anything and it wouldn't matter. But in my opinion, even if this is true for the robots in the park, anyone's deeds affects all real humans that are in there: this park welcomes anyone, even sensitives persons like children, and a crime will - I think - traumatise anyone. I this park you can "rape" or "kill" a robot without any consequences and just this fact make me uncomfortable.

In a second time, I just don't see the point of this amusement park since I don't want to neither do immoral things that cannot be done usually nor play with robots. 

Even I said that I will not be interested to go there, I stay open minded and I'd be curious to see the robots and how they work.

<h1 class="h1">C1L5 - Musk's warning</h1>
![[1c1l5-text.jpeg]]

1) Elon Musk is worried about the potential gain of power and DOMINATION of AI. To him, AI is the biggest "risk to human civilisation"
2) Laws to regulate things are usually made after an accident occurs. According to Elon Musk, this has to change because we have to prevent the cataclysm not repair it in that it could be impossible to.
3) Elon's biggest fear regarding autonomous cars is that a malicious person hack a software "to take control of an entire fleet of vehicles" .
#### Correction
1)  Elon is worried about the advance of AI  in that thinks that AI is a threat to human civilisation.
2) Laws are casually made when something bad happens or when there is something wrong with the last law. But for Elon Musk the procedure is really too slow. 
    As far as E. Musk is concerned, he believes that laws should follow the same speed of development as the AI industry. 
1) He fears autonomous cars can be hacked and create accidents.
   Elon Musk is the CEO of the leading autonomous car brand in the world so we should probably take his fears into account.
