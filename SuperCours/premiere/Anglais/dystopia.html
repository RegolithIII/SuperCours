    <h2 class ="h2"> C1L1:</h2>
Dystopia: = Dys (bad)+Topos (place)
    •  future
    •  bad
    • dark
    • gloomy
Utopia: = U (negative) +Topos (place)
A good place that does not exist.

The word dystopia comes from the word utopia but added the prefix dys-.
It is an ideal world which has gone wrong. Dystopian fictions take place in the future, they warn us against the government,
a pandemic or technologies.
A dystopi often illustrates the adventures of a hero lives in a post-apocalyptic world.
Example: 

    • The Maze Runner
    • Ready Player One
    • Matrix
    • The Hunger Game
    • Divergent
    • The Walking Dead

This picture is a still from the movie 1984, which was released in 1956. It was derived from the eponymous book by George Orwell.
This picture is divided into 3 areas.
    1) On the left hand side, we have a wall where it reads “WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH”. 
    These words are antitheses or even oxymorons. They are the government moto, and they reveal it probably is a dictatorship.
    2) At the bottom, we have a very horizontal zone. It shows a city. Buildings are derelict. This area reveals that people are crushed by the government 
    because it is at the bottom of the picture.
    3) At the top we have another area, which draws our attention in that it is very vertical: huge pyramids are towering the city. They may be the home of the government
    or of powerful people. Aerostats seem to loom over the population too: they are under surveillance.

From what we already know about the video, we can expect that the movie will turn into a criticism of a whole society not yet getting better after the WW2 and
the industrial revolution.

Given what we already know we can infer that the film is a dystopia depicting a divided society, in which a dictator has taken control of the government.
From the information available so far, we can expect the movie to be a dystopia fiction.

Wait + C: Attendre + C (ex: le bus).

1) The ministry of truth is a pyramidal building with a moto “War is peace, Freedom is slavery, Ignorance is strength”. It’s aim is to put a frame on the society. 
It is the Ministry which is saying if something is legal or not. It create laws too and decides who will be punished. 
2) In Winston’s society, people are punished by death, they can go to a labour camp for 25 years.
3) Winston was about to write a diary.

1° The ministry of Truth is a huge pyramid where the government is settled. The slogans of the party is written on the wall.
There is only one truth and it’s controlled by the ministry.
2° The extract describes a very strict society, in which people are oppressed. They have few liberties. People are not allowed to write, maybe they don’t even know how to write. 
The government is not in favour of education.  It says that there are no laws but people can be punished (death, or prison): it reveals that justice is arbitrary. 
It’s typical of a dictatorship.
3° Winston would like to write something in a diary. He risks death or a life sentence in a force-labour camp.
People are compelled to work for the government and be ignorant as it want.
Winston is not allowed to write a diary to spread his idea.
In that society, it’s not authorised to have a thought and a mind.
 Winston is (not) allowed to write in a diary but if the government finds out, he will be compelled to 25 years of forced labour-camp.
It’s forbidden to give a headbutt to the dictator.
Winston is compelled to hide to write in his diary.

This episode is a kind of catharsis in that is shows the main protagonist’ s life being destroyed by her own decisions. It illustrates the fact that social medias make us be somebody we are not. On social medias we are not ourselves. 
The point of this episode (and of all dystopia actually) to have us think about the reality. It aims at sensitizing us to the issue of social medias.
